<h1>CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan - Cossie Play</h1>

<p>Name: Nguyen Quang Duy<br>
JCU ID :13688651 <br>
Subject: CP1406

<p><b>Goals: </b><br>

We are small family-run local business, operating in Hulkstown since 2012, hoping to improve our business by getting on the Internet<br>

<p><b>Success Evaluation: </b><br>

We create custom cosplay and fancy dress costumes and run a monthly cosplay party. We get about 30 people to the parties each month and make about 4 costumes per week - not enough. The website should help us be more successful at these. Dressing up is fun, good for the socially awkward and very creative. 

<p><b>Target Audience: </b><br>

We get cosplayers of all ages, but mostly they are 35 - 50. We want the site to appeal to a younger audience than this, getting high school kids and young adults cosplaying.
